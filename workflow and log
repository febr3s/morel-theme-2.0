# Workflow

1. Create an "issue" (bigger task) with an enhacement or documentation tag
2. Unpack it into smaller tasks
3. Create a branch with the same name of the issue
4. Code and commit until finishing one of the smaller tasks. 
5. Checkout to main and merge from the created branch
6. Cross it on the ticket as complete
7. Checkout back to the created branch and repeat form # 4 until finishing the bigger task
8. Mark "issue" as resolved on Github
9. Create a new "issue"
